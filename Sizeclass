What‚Äôs Size Classes ?
Size Classes enables creating adaptive interfaces that seamlessly adjust for different device sizes and orientations, thus simplifying the process of adaptive layouts.

wC hC -> (Compact Width 		Compact Height)
wR hC -> (Regular Width		Compact Height)
wR hR -> (Regular Width 		Regular Height)
wC hR -> (Compact Width		Regular Height)

What is this üßê ?
Interface Builder recognises nine different size classes. The above 4 size classes are `Final Size Classes`
The remaining 5 are `Base Size Classes`. Let‚Äôs not dive deep into it now.

Let‚Äôs use Size Classes on a UILabel in Interface Builder, to understand how it works

1. Drag and drop a UILabel on a view
2. Set desired constraints
3. Now go to Attribute Inspector
4. Customising font size of label [Size class variant for iPad (wR hR) to display headline label with font size of 80]
